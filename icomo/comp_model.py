    ----------

        Dictionary/nested python structure of compartments. Keys are the names of the

    y: PyTree[jax.Array]
        Dictionary or pytree of compartments. Keys/indices are the names of the
        compartments and values are :class:`jax.Array` that represent their value.
    dy: PyTree[jax.Array]
        Dictionary or pytree of compartments. Keys/indices are the names of the
        compartments and values are :class:`jax.Array` that represent their
